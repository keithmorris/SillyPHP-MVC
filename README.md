SillyPHP-MVC
============

Yet another PHP MVC Framework. This was not built to be a production MVC Framework but rather as a learning tool for me around building a more robust and flexible framework.

I built this framework in a couple of days simply as an exercise to gain a greater understanding building an MVC framework from the ground up. There are still lots of inefficiencies here and I really would not recommend using this in any production sense that is expecting a ton of traffic as it has not been thoroughly tested.

However, as the system is not overly complex, you may find it useful to dig through if you're new to MVC frameworks to learn a bit about how they can be put together.

I would love to hear from folks with suggestions for improvement.
